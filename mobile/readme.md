# Alera

Alera is the Android/iOS companion app for remote Alera work. It is a separate Flutter app so mobile plugins and platform manifests do not leak into the desktop app package.

## Current Surface

- Pair a host with a QR-first flow: scan the pairing QR from the desktop pairing dialog (torch toggle included), or paste the JSON payload from `alera mobile --json pairing create` through the manual entry sheet. A confirmation step shows the host identity, endpoint, and a live offer-expiry countdown, plus an optional device name before pairing. Failures surface as titled states (Invalid Offer, Offer Expired, Runtime Mismatch, Could Not Reach Runtime) with retry and manual-entry actions.
- Claim the pairing offer over the mobile WebSocket gateway and store the returned device token in platform secure storage.
- Authenticate with `mobile.hello`, then land on a dense workspace list mirroring the desktop sidebar. Shared view preferences cover grouping, project/workspace sorting, project/tag and workspace-kind filters, section collapse, project collapse, parent-workspace collapse, and pins; desktop initializes the shared runtime record and wins revision conflicts, while mobile search stays transient. Pull to refresh, the visible search toolbar, Pinned and All sections, project grouping, and the parent/child tree use the same runtime snapshot.
- Use the visible three-dot menu or long-press a workspace to rename, pin/unpin, assign or create tags, configure or unlink the parent, open the repository in the phone browser, copy the host path, sleep the workspace, or remove a managed workspace. Sleep always confirms, then closes every tab and terminal session for that workspace without deleting its branch or files. Runtimes released before this behavior may retain tabs after Sleep until the host is updated. Removal follows the shared confirmation preference and only offers branch deletion for Alera-created branches, never reused branches. The New Workspace flow supports branch selection, source branch, existing-branch reuse, name, and parent workspace. The full parity surface requires `mobileWorkspaceSidebarParityV1`; older runtimes show an update-required state instead of a reduced workspace UI.
- Rename terminal and non-terminal tabs from the tab action sheet. Terminal chips follow OSC 0/2 title changes for every running session, including tabs not selected on the phone, while manual renames keep priority. This live synchronization uses `mobileTerminalTitlesV1`; older runtimes continue showing the stored tab title. Non-terminal content remains unavailable on mobile, but its runtime-owned title stays synchronized with desktop.
- Open host Settings to manage the workspace directory, project/workspace removal confirmations, all nine agent-status hooks, CLI registration, and the `alera-cli` and `alera-orchestration` skills through Auto, npx, or bunx. These settings belong to the runtime and update live across desktop and mobile; Terminal Quick Keys stay local to the phone.
- Inspect quotas in a dedicated screen, refresh manually, and configure provider order, Claude Default and CCS profiles, and credential environment variable names. Quotas refresh on entry and every five minutes while visible, and secret values never leave the host.
- Workspace rows show an aggregate agent count and highest urgency. Tapping a workspace opens its tabs screen, where each tab also shows its agent status for Codex, Claude, Copilot, Cursor, Antigravity, OpenCode, Pi, Amp, and Grok. Tabs remain horizontally scrollable with one tab visible at a time and no splits on the phone. The `+` button creates numbered terminal tabs, and chip delete closes a tab and terminates its session. The full-screen terminal uses the vendored Flutter `xterm` with JetBrains Mono, attaches with the measured viewport, and forwards resizes as the keyboard opens and closes.
- Terminal input has two modes per tab: compose (default), where you type a full command in a field and send it as one write (long-press Send offers sending without a newline), and direct, an opt-in toggle that streams every keystroke straight to the PTY. A configurable quick-key bar sits above the keyboard in both modes with Esc, Tab, Shift+Tab, arrows, and Ctrl combos; keys can be reordered, hidden, or extended with custom key combos (Ctrl/Alt/Shift plus any key) from the Terminal Quick Keys screen, persisted across launches.
- Opening a terminal claims its viewport (the mobile presence lock): the PTY resizes to the phone screen, the desktop pane shows a banner naming the driving device with Take Back actions, and desktop resizes are held for later instead of fighting the phone. When the desktop takes the terminal back the phone returns to the workspace list; detaching or losing the connection releases the claim and restores the desktop dims automatically. Feature-detected through the `terminalDriverPresence` runtime capability.
- Host status, projects, and branch summaries remain available under Host Details.
- Keep multiple Alera account sessions in platform secure storage. Settings > Accounts asks a selected paired runtime for a one-time delegation and redeems it directly, without asking the phone to repeat Google or GitHub sign-in or making the user copy a second code. Enrolled runtimes are grouped under each account and control Attention, Done, and Terminal Exit notifications independently. Attention is enabled by default; Done and Terminal Exit are opt-in.
- Register one app-wide FCM token with every enrolled account, reconcile subscriptions after token rotation, and receive notification-plus-data messages while foregrounded, backgrounded, or terminated. Foreground messages always use an Alera local banner. Tapping a message resolves the terminal first, then its workspace, then its paired host without opening an unrelated terminal when the original target is gone.

## Cloud And Firebase Configuration

The cloud client defaults to `https://api.alera.build/`. Override it for local development with `--dart-define=ALERA_CLOUD_BASE_URL=https://.../`. Tests override the injected API and never call the network.

Android and iOS use the same Firebase app for debug and release. No production Firebase values are stored in this repository. Supply all four values when running or building:

```bash
flutter run \
  --dart-define=ALERA_FIREBASE_API_KEY=... \
  --dart-define=ALERA_FIREBASE_APP_ID=... \
  --dart-define=ALERA_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=... \
  --dart-define=ALERA_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
```

Android may instead use a real `android/app/google-services.json`; the Gradle plugin is applied only when that file exists, so analysis and tests stay buildable before Firebase is provisioned. `android/app/google-services.example.json` documents the expected package `dev.leynier.alera_mobile`. iOS can use the dart defines above; `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.example.plist` documents the matching bundle `dev.leynier.aleraMobile`.

The Firebase sender must use notification-plus-data messages. Data keys are `accountId`, `runtimeId`, `eventId`, `eventType`, `category`, optional `workspaceId`, and optional `tabId`. Supported categories are `attention`, `done`, and `terminalExit`; event types describe the specific runtime event within those categories. Android channels are `alera_attention` and `alera_activity`.

iOS background notification mode and the APNs entitlement are present, but real delivery remains unverified until Apple signing is configured and an APNs key is uploaded to Firebase. On Android, a force-stop from system settings prevents FCM delivery until the app is reopened. On iOS, swiping the app away can likewise pause background delivery until the next launch.

## Local Commands

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze
flutter test
```

Regenerate the native launcher icons and splash screens after changing files under `assets/branding/`:

```bash
dart run flutter_launcher_icons -f flutter_launcher_icons.yaml
dart run flutter_native_splash:create --path=flutter_native_splash.yaml
```

## Android Releases

Run the unified **Cut Release** GitHub Actions workflow to create releases. It detects changes under `mobile/` independently from desktop changes and derives the next patch, minor, or major version from Conventional Commit metadata. Mobile tags use `vX.Y.Z-mobile` for stable releases and `vX.Y.Z-rc.N-mobile` for release candidates, independently from desktop tags. Mobile release notes only include changes that touch `mobile/`, and mobile releases never take the repository's Latest badge (it stays on the desktop release). When mobile changed, the workflow analyzes and tests the app, builds universal and architecture-specific APKs, verifies SHA-256 checksums, creates a draft GitHub Release, uploads and attests every artifact, and publishes only after the complete asset set passes verification. Use its `dry_run` input to preview the release plan without creating builds, commits, tags, or releases.

iOS publishing remains disabled until Apple signing and provisioning are configured; the generated iOS icon and splash resources continue to be maintained in the project.

Release APKs are signed with the stable upload keystore stored in the `ALERA_ANDROID_*` repository secrets (see `docs/release-trust.md`), and the workflow fails if they are missing. Local `flutter build apk --release` without `android/key.properties` falls back to the debug key; such APKs cannot update over release-signed installs.

Pairing payloads come from the runtime profile:

```bash
alera mobile --json enable --bind-host 127.0.0.1 --port 6768
alera mobile --json pairing create --endpoint ws://127.0.0.1:6768
```

The CLI starts or reuses a mobile-capable runtime host for enable and pairing creation so the gateway is accepting WebSocket connections before it returns a pairing payload. Mobile access is opt-in; use `alera mobile --json disable` to stop publishing the gateway and disconnect active mobile clients.

## Remote Access Modes

The gateway has four endpoint modes, selectable from Settings > Mobile Devices in the desktop app (This Device / Tailscale / NetBird / Manual) or persisted through the CLI:

- **This Device (default)**: loopback bind. `ws://` pairing endpoints are accepted only for loopback/local development, and their explicit port must match the local gateway port. Run `alera mobile --json enable --port <port>` first when changing the local gateway port for loopback `ws://` pairing.
- **Tailscale (recommended for remote access)**: run `alera mobile --json enable --tailscale` or pick the Tailscale mode in settings. The runtime verifies Tailscale is installed and running, binds the gateway to this machine's tailnet IPv4 (100.64.0.0/10), and emits pairing offers with `ws://<tailnet-ip>:<port>`. Plaintext `ws://` is acceptable here because traffic between tailnet devices rides Tailscale's WireGuard tunnel; the phone additionally refuses to store credentials when the pairing response's runtime id does not match the offer. The phone must have the Tailscale app installed and be signed in to the same tailnet. Tailscale is detected, never bundled: install it from https://tailscale.com/download on both devices.
- **NetBird**: run `alera mobile --json enable --netbird` or pick NetBird in settings. The runtime reads `netbird status --json`, requires a connected NetBird peer, and supports three address sources: the NetBird IPv4 (`--netbird-endpoint ip`), the peer DNS/FQDN reported by status (`--netbird-endpoint dns`), or the private interface address resolved from the reported interface (normally `wt0`, `--netbird-endpoint interface`). The desktop exposes the same choices and shows the hostname and interface when available. This is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and works with NetBird Cloud and self-hosted management servers. NetBird is detected, never bundled: install and sign in on both devices, and ensure the peer policy permits the gateway port.
- **Manual (advanced)**: publish the gateway yourself through a TLS tunnel or proxy and create the pairing payload with an explicit `wss://<host-or-vpn-name>:<port>` endpoint; that public TLS port can differ from the local gateway port. When the gateway intentionally binds `0.0.0.0`, `pairing create` requires an explicit reachable `--endpoint` because phones cannot connect to a wildcard address.

### Tailscale Troubleshooting

- `tailscale is not installed`: install Tailscale on the desktop, or use the Manual mode with a `wss://` endpoint.
- `tailscale is installed but not running`: run `tailscale up` and sign in, then retry.
- The phone cannot connect on Windows: allow Alera through Windows Firewall for incoming connections on the gateway port (the settings pane shows a hint when the Tailscale mode is active on Windows).
- The phone cannot connect anywhere: confirm the Tailscale app is connected on the phone, that both devices appear in the same tailnet, and that the tailnet's ACLs allow the connection.
- After removing the machine from the tailnet, the gateway may fail to bind its stale tailnet IP on restart; re-run `alera mobile --json enable --tailscale` or switch modes in settings to re-resolve.

### NetBird Troubleshooting

- `netbird is not installed`: install NetBird on the desktop, or use the Manual mode with a `wss://` endpoint.
- `netbird is installed but not connected`: run `netbird up`, sign in to NetBird Cloud or your self-hosted management server, then retry.
- The phone cannot connect: confirm both peers are connected to the same NetBird network and that NetBird access policies allow the gateway port.
- DNS hostname offers require NetBird DNS to be enabled and reachable from the phone; otherwise select the IP or interface address source.
- If the interface option cannot bind, confirm the reported interface exists and has an IPv4 address. NetBird's default interface is `wt0`, but custom interface names are supported when the client reports them.

## Remaining Work

The live transport includes host status, projects, branches, desktop-parity workspace organization and actions, agent status, tab rename, runtime-portable settings, quotas, host tools, and terminal streaming. File review, non-terminal tab content surfaces, and end-to-end encrypted payloads are intentionally left for later mobile iterations.
