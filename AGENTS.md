# AGENTS

## Scope

This file applies to the entire repository. Nested `AGENTS.md` files may add rules for a subdirectory; when they do, follow both the root file and the nested file.

This document defines contributor and agent governance only. It does not change runtime APIs, schemas, or protocol types.

## Core Operating Principles

- Prefer clear, traceable work over implicit progress. Keep the user informed about what is being done, what remains, and any relevant blockers.
- Use these instructions by default. If a specific task requires a different approach, explain the reason clearly before deviating.
- Keep plans and outputs portable across agent runtimes unless the user asks for behavior tied to a specific tool.
- Avoid unnecessary complexity. Choose the simplest approach that satisfies the user's stated goal and preserves correctness.

## Task Tracking

- Agents MUST use the available task-tracking tool whenever the work has multiple steps, meaningful uncertainty, or a non-trivial implementation path.
- Track tasks as pending, in progress, and completed so the current state of the work stays explicit.
- Update the task list as work progresses, not only at the end.
- Keep task entries concrete and outcome-oriented. Each task should describe a verifiable unit of work.
- When new work is discovered, add it to the tracker instead of relying on memory.
- When a task becomes irrelevant, mark or explain it rather than silently dropping it.
- Before finishing, reconcile the tracker with the actual work completed and call out anything intentionally left undone.

## Code Generation Workflow

- Riverpod providers MUST use code generation (`riverpod_generator`) rather than hand-written provider declarations.
- This repository does NOT use a `build_runner` watcher. Agents MUST NOT run `build_runner watch` or keep any background code-generation process alive.
- When a planned batch of edits touches Riverpod, Drift, or `dart_mappable` generated surfaces, agents MUST finish the planned edits first and then regenerate code once for the whole batch with `dart run build_runner build`. Do not regenerate after every individual edit.
- The one-shot generation MUST run before `dart format`, `flutter analyze`, and tests, so formatting, static analysis, and test runs always see the final generated code.
- Agents MUST verify the regenerated files are included alongside the source changes that produced them.

## Native Rust Layer

- Alera runs a Rust layer under Flutter through `flutter_rust_bridge` v2. `rust/` is a Cargo workspace whose root package is the FRB git library `alera_native` (`cdylib`/`staticlib`) and whose member `alera-cli` is the terminal-host sidecar binary (see *Process And Terminal Safety*). The Flutter build plugin is at `rust_builder/`, and the generated Dart bindings at `lib/src/rust/` (committed, not regenerated in CI). `RustLib.init()` runs in `lib/main.dart` before `runApp`. The FRB native build (`cargo build --manifest-path rust/Cargo.toml`, no `-p`) compiles only the root `alera_native` package, so it never drags in the sidecar's dependencies.
- Git operations MUST go through the `GitBackend` boundary (`lib/src/shared/infra/git/`), not by spawning the `git` binary via `ProcessRunner`. The production implementation `RustGitBackend` calls the Rust API; local operations use `git2` (libgit2) and the networked ones (`clone`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`) are delegated to the `git` CLI through `alera_core::git::git_in_dir` so the system credential helper keeps working. That helper is the only place those invocations are built: it pipes stdio, sets `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` (nothing can answer a terminal prompt there, and on Windows there is no console to draw one on), and spawns through `alera_core::child_process::suppress_console_window`.
- Keep the `GitBackend` interface free of generated bridge types: `RustGitBackend` is the only place that imports `lib/src/rust/api/git.dart`, and it translates the native `GitError` into the domain `GitException` hierarchy. Services depend on `GitBackend`; unit tests use the shared `FakeGitBackend` (`test/unit/fake_git_backend.dart`).
- After changing the Rust API surface (`rust/src/api`), regenerate bindings with `make frb-generate` (`flutter_rust_bridge_codegen generate`) and commit the result. Building the desktop app requires a Rust toolchain (`rustup`), pinned by `rust/rust-toolchain.toml`; CI installs it via `dtolnay/rust-toolchain`. The shared `rust/Cargo.lock` is committed and the native hooks build with `--locked`, so a regenerated lock must stay complete for both crates.

## Spec-Driven Planning

When planning is needed, use a spec-driven development flow. Do not jump straight from a vague request to implementation if important product or technical decisions are still undefined.

### Spec Discovery

- First clarify the desired behavior, success criteria, audience, inputs, outputs, constraints, and non-goals.
- Prefer discovering facts from the repository, environment, or existing documentation before asking the user.
- Ask targeted questions only for decisions that cannot be safely inferred.
- Convert ambiguous requests into explicit requirements before designing a solution.

### Design

- Define the implementation approach after the spec is stable.
- Identify affected interfaces, data flow, dependencies, storage, permissions, error handling, and compatibility constraints when relevant.
- Surface meaningful tradeoffs and choose a default when one option is clearly safer or simpler.
- Keep the design aligned with existing project conventions.

### Tasking

- Break the design into ordered, concrete tasks that can be implemented and verified.
- Include validation steps as first-class tasks, not as an afterthought.
- Present plans using the structure: spec, design, tasks, tests, and assumptions.
- Make the plan decision complete: another engineer or agent should be able to execute it without inventing missing requirements.

## Clipboard Usage

- Use the clipboard when it helps transfer commands, snippets, paths, reports, or other information to the user efficiently.
- Prefer native clipboard commands for the user's operating system:
  - macOS: `pbcopy` and `pbpaste`.
  - Windows PowerShell: `Set-Clipboard` and `Get-Clipboard`.
  - Linux Wayland: `wl-copy` and `wl-paste`.
  - Linux X11: `xclip` or `xsel`.
  - WSL: `clip.exe` when copying content into the Windows clipboard is appropriate.
- Tell the user what was copied, especially when the clipboard content is long or operationally important.
- Avoid placing secrets, tokens, credentials, personal data, or destructive commands on the clipboard unless the user explicitly asks for it or the task clearly requires it.
- If clipboard tooling is unavailable or unsafe in the current environment, provide the exact command or content for the user to copy manually.

## Git And Pull Requests

- Use Conventional Commit style for commit messages.
- Write commit messages and pull request titles in English unless the user explicitly requests another language.
- Commit messages and pull request titles MUST be lowercase.
- Prefer concise commit subjects that clearly describe the change, such as `fix: handle empty clipboard input`, `docs: update agent workflow rules`, or `chore: add repository instructions`.
- Keep pull request descriptions short and useful. Include a brief summary, validation performed, and any important risks or notes when relevant.
- Never add the agent as a coauthor, assisted-by, generated-by, or equivalent attribution in commits, pull requests, pull request descriptions, or related metadata unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Keep changes scoped to the user request. Do not fold unrelated refactors into implementation work.
- This document SHALL remain organized with non-numbered section headers.

## Communication Expectations

- Be direct and specific. Explain decisions, blockers, and verification results in practical terms.
- Do not hide uncertainty. If something is assumed, say so.
- Keep progress updates short but useful during longer work.
- When implementation is complete, summarize what changed, how it was verified, and any remaining risk or follow-up.

## Worktree Safety

- Always read and edit files from the active working directory.
- Never follow absolute paths copied from another agent or another worktree unless they are revalidated in the current checkout.
- Before mutating git state, check for existing local changes and preserve user work.
- If `.git/index.lock` exists, confirm no git process is active before removing it.

## Code Comments

- Add comments only when they explain a non-obvious reason: safety, platform behavior, compatibility, release constraints, or a design-system rule.
- Keep comments brief. Do not narrate what the code already says.

## Markdown Style

- Do not hard-wrap Markdown prose. Keep each paragraph or list item on one line unless the line break is semantically meaningful.
- Preserve explicit line breaks in tables, code fences, lists, and generated templates where Markdown syntax requires them.
- Never use em-dashes (`—`) anywhere in the repository: not in Markdown, code comments, UI copy, CLI output, or tests. Use a plain hyphen (`-`) instead.

## Naming

- Do not create vague modules named `helpers`, `utils`, `common`, `misc`, or similar dumping grounds.
- Name files and types after the domain concept they model, such as `workspace_folder_opener.dart` or `update_archive.dart`.
- If a file name starts feeling generic, split responsibilities before adding more code.
- Avoid files longer than 500 lines. When a file approaches that size, split it by concrete domain responsibility instead of adding more unrelated code.

## Flutter UI Rules

- Flutter UI values MUST come from `AleraTokens` and `ThemeData`.
- New UI code MUST NOT introduce ad-hoc visual literals for color, spacing, radius, duration, or typography when an existing token/theme value covers the role.
- `Colors.transparent` MAY be used only for explicit transparent states.
- Visible UI copy MUST use title case for actions, buttons, menus, dropdowns, labels, and other controls. Descriptions, explanations, helper text, status messages, errors, notifications, and other prose MUST use sentence case, preserving proper nouns, product names, acronyms, and technical identifiers.
- The active app theme strategy SHALL remain dark-mode-only in this version.
- Typography MUST remain fixed to Inter for general text and JetBrains Mono for monospaced text.
- The canonical design-system reference is `docs/ui-styleguide.md`.
- Shared, reusable UI components live in `lib/src/design_system/`, grouped by role and prefixed `Alera`. New screens MUST reuse these before introducing ad-hoc widgets; a genuinely new shared component belongs here, with a co-located `*.preview.dart`.
- Design-system components MUST be presentational: data and callbacks in via parameters, no Riverpod reads and no native (`dart:io`/`dart:ffi`) code, so they stay previewable. Wire providers in a thin feature-level wrapper instead.
- Preview functions MUST use the `@AleraPreview` annotation (not the bare `@Preview`). Launch with `flutter widget-preview start`.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- Shortcut-able actions live in `lib/src/features/keyboard/domain/keyboard_action.dart` as the single source of truth (id, label, group, per-platform defaults, allow-in-terminal flag). New shortcut-able actions MUST be added to that registry rather than wired through ad-hoc `Shortcuts`/`CallbackShortcuts` widgets.
- Behavior is dispatched from one place: `KeyboardCommandDispatcher`. Reuse existing controller methods and the shared dialog launchers in `workbench_dialog_launchers.dart`; do not duplicate dialog flows.
- Matching is centralized in `KeybindingResolver` and consumed by exactly two call sites: the global `KeyboardShortcutsScope` (shell-mounted) and the `TerminalSurface` `onKeyEvent` hook (terminal-focused interception). Do not add a third matcher or a global `HardwareKeyboard` handler.
- The `Mod` modifier is platform-neutral (⌘ on macOS, Ctrl elsewhere). Use the canonical token form (`Mod+Shift+BracketRight`) in defaults; symbol aliases (`,`, `[`) are accepted at parse time.
- Respect the `TerminalShortcutPolicy` setting: under `terminalFirst`, only bindings with `allowInTerminal: true` may intercept while a terminal is focused.

## Cross-Platform Desktop Rules

- Alera targets macOS, Windows, and Linux.
- Use `Platform` checks or framework abstractions for platform-specific behavior; do not assume POSIX paths or commands.
- Use `path` package utilities for filesystem paths.
- Keep terminal, process, workspace, updater, and release code explicit about platform support.
- UI shortcut labels must match the actual shortcut behavior for the current platform.
- The application menu uses the global `PlatformMenuBar` on macOS and a compact Flutter menu beside the app name on Windows/Linux, so those platforms do not lose client-area height to a native `GtkMenuBar` or `HMENU`. Menu actions share `lib/src/features/app_menu/presentation/app_menu_actions.dart`; keep their labels and behavior in sync across the platform presentations. Menu controls MUST NOT register keyboard accelerators, so keys like Ctrl+C keep flowing to text fields and the terminal-first shortcut policy. Because Alera is dark-only, Windows enables process-wide dark mode through `windows/runner/win32_dark_mode.cpp`.

## Flutter Performance

- Performance is a product requirement. UI changes must keep the Flutter frame pipeline responsive and avoid unnecessary rebuilds, layout churn, blocking I/O, and heavy synchronous work.
- Do not run expensive parsing, filesystem traversal, process output processing, hashing, serialization, or other CPU-heavy work on the main isolate when it can reasonably run in another isolate.
- Prefer isolate-backed workers, `compute`, streamed processing, or incremental batching for work that can grow with repository size, terminal output size, release artifact size, or user data size.
- Keep main-isolate work limited to UI state coordination and small transformations needed for rendering.
- When a main-isolate implementation is intentionally kept, document the reason in code or PR notes if the workload could plausibly become large.
- On Linux a frame costs CPU whether or not it changed anything: the GTK3 embedder reads the rendered surface back and composites it in software on the platform thread (`gdk_cairo_draw_from_gl`), which no GDK setting avoids and which scales with the window's pixels. Reducing how many frames are produced therefore beats making a frame cheaper. Anything that streams (terminal output above all) MUST NOT request a frame per vsync for as long as data keeps arriving; pace it instead, and measure with the benchmarks under `integration_test/` rather than assuming. See `docs/performance.md`.

## Process And Terminal Safety

- Treat shell and terminal behavior as user-visible product behavior.
- Do not assume a local shell exists when the code path could later support remote or constrained environments.
- Keep command execution behind `ProcessRunner` or a similarly injectable boundary. `ProcessRunner`'s production implementation is `RustProcessRunner`, which spawns through the bridge (`rust/src/api/process.rs`) rather than `dart:io`, because Dart cannot pass Windows creation flags. It keeps `runInShell` semantics on every platform: the shell is what resolves the `.cmd`/`.bat` shims that `ollama`, `claude` and `npm` install, and `process_shell.rs` mirrors Dart's `_getShellArguments` quoting so no call site changes meaning.
- No process may be spawned with a bare `Command::new`. Every spawn goes through `alera_core::child_process::windowless_command` / `windowless_async_command`, and `rust/clippy.toml` rejects the constructors so a new call site cannot forget. The reason is Windows-only but structural: the Flutter runner is a GUI-subsystem binary and the sidecar starts detached, so neither has a console, and Windows gives a console child launched from such a process a new console *with a visible window* - the terminal that used to flash during a `git fetch` or a quota poll. `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` asks for a console without a window instead, and grandchildren inherit it, so marking a `cmd.exe` wrapper covers the whole chain.
- A host-side lookup or spawn that depends on user configuration MUST resolve its environment through `rust/alera-cli/src/login_shell_environment.rs`, not `std::env` alone. The app starts the sidecar detached, so a GUI launch (Finder, Dock, a `.desktop` entry) hands it an environment with none of the user's shell rc exports and a PATH that omits Homebrew and every version manager. A terminal tab does not have this problem because the shell it launches sources those files itself, which is exactly why the two silently disagreed: quota lookups reported accounts as unconfigured that were configured, and CLIs as missing that were installed. `login_shell_variable` for a single value, `login_shell_command_environment` / `apply_login_shell_environment` for a spawn. The process environment always wins, so an explicit override is never masked, and Windows is exempt because user and system variables already reach GUI processes there. The hydrated map may hold API keys: it is memory-only and MUST NOT be logged or persisted.
- Tests for command construction should verify Windows, Linux, and macOS variants when behavior differs.
- Cases in `orchestration_review_regressions::deferred_delivery_cases` fail intermittently under the parallelism of a full `make rust-test` and pass in isolation; they drive real PTYs, and which case flakes varies between runs (`coordinator_promotion_waits_for_deferred_delivery`, `cancelling_active_worker_interrupts_before_idle_banner_delivery`, and `push_on_idle_does_not_duplicate_in_flight_batches` have all been observed). Re-run the named case on its own before treating a red `rust-test` as a real regression, and do not chase it as fallout from an unrelated change.
- Use the lowercase repository `makefile` for app/CLI debug workflows instead of keeping one-off commands in chat or local notes. Its debug targets must remain shell-neutral and route platform-specific behavior through Dart scripts under `tool/debug/` so they work from PowerShell 7 on Windows as well as Linux and macOS shells. `make help` lists available rules. `make app-debug` runs the Flutter app with the development CLI fallback (a `cargo run` of the Rust sidecar), `make cli-build` compiles the Rust `alera` CLI sidecar (the `rust/alera-cli` crate) with cargo, `make app-debug-bundled-cli` runs the app against the compiled sidecar, `make host-debug` runs the Rust `alera terminal-host` in the foreground, and `make rust-test` runs fmt/clippy/test for the crate.
- When debugging persistent terminal behavior, inspect process separation with `make debug-processes`; the UI process should be the Flutter app and the host process should be `alera terminal-host`. Use `ALERA_HOST_EMPTY_SHUTDOWN_SECONDS`, `ALERA_HOST_DETACHED_SHUTDOWN_SECONDS`, and `ALERA_HOST_SCROLLBACK_BYTES` when foreground host debugging needs non-default lifecycle or scrollback values. Use `make host-stop` only when intentionally ending the current debug host for this app id.
- The shipped `alera` CLI / terminal-host sidecar is the Rust crate under `rust/` (`rust/alera-cli`, binary `alera`). The native build hooks - `linux/CMakeLists.txt`, `windows/CMakeLists.txt`, and the macOS "Build Alera CLI Sidecar" Xcode phase - build it with `cargo build --locked` (Release app → `--release`, otherwise debug) and install the single binary into `resources/alera/alera[.exe]`. The toolchain is pinned by `rust/rust-toolchain.toml` and `rust/Cargo.lock` is committed; CI and the hooks build reproducibly with `--locked`. The Dart client-side and shared protocol files under `lib/src/features/workbench/infra/terminal_host/` stay active because they connect the app to the sidecar over the socket.
- PTY output framing is negotiated per client, never per host. A client asks for length-prefixed binary frames in its `hello` (`binaryFrames: true`) only when the control file advertises `RUNTIME_HOST_BINARY_FRAMES_CAPABILITY`; the host answers with what it granted and every later byte on that connection is framed. This MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`, because a version mismatch makes the app treat a live host as unusable, and because the `alera` CLI (`runtime_host_client.rs`) and older apps must keep getting newline-delimited JSON from the same host. The switch travels **in band**, as a `ClientFrame::UpgradeToBinary` queued behind the hello response on the same lane: a shared flag could flip before the response was written and frame a response the client is still reading as a line. Frame layout lives in `rust/alera-cli/src/terminal_host/frame_codec.rs` and its Dart mirror `terminal_host_frame_codec.dart`, which has a fixed-bytes test so the two cannot drift.
- Per-session CPU and memory sampling lives in the sidecar, never in the app: the host already owns the PTYs and the `sessionId -> workspaceId -> tabId` relation, and a process-table sweep must stay off the Flutter main isolate. `Session.shell` MUST be cleared on exit and terminate, because the OS recycles pids and a stale value silently attributes a stranger's process to a dead session. Clearing alone is not enough: the OS reaps the shell before the reader thread reports the exit, so the field also carries the start time observed at spawn (`seal_shell_process`), and a sweep attributes a subtree only while the pid still holds that start time (`ProcessIndex::holds`). A root that fails the check reports `measured: false` instead of billing a stranger's memory to a terminal. The comparison has second resolution, so it bounds that window rather than closing it. When summing subtrees, claim the session roots before the host root and share one `claimed` set: every PTY shell is a child of the runtime host, so the opposite order swallows all of them into one unattributed row. `resources.snapshot` and `resourceMonitorV1` are additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`. Every `cpuPercent` on that payload is per core, the unit `sysinfo` reports, and it MUST stay that way: the app can attach to an already-running older sidecar, so the meaning cannot depend on which side is newer. Normalization is app-side, in `machineCpuShare` (`lib/src/features/resource_manager/domain/machine_cpu_share.dart`), which divides by `cpuCoreCount` so the panel reads as a share of the machine like the memory column does, and returns absent rather than a raw number when the core count is unknown. How many sweeps `sysinfo` needs before process CPU is meaningful differs per platform (3 on Windows, 2 on Linux and macOS), and CI runs `cargo test --workspace` on Linux only, so changes to the sampler MUST be re-verified on a real Windows and macOS machine. Every process refresh MUST ask for `without_tasks()`: `ProcessRefreshKind::nothing()` is not nothing, it defaults `tasks` on, and on Linux that puts every thread in the table as a child process reporting the whole process's RSS, so a subtree total scales with the thread count rather than measuring memory (the app read 26x its real size at 97 threads, and CPU double counts because the leader's `/proc/<pid>/stat` is already the thread-group aggregate). Neither the `claimed` set nor the tree arithmetic can catch this, since every tid is a distinct unclaimed pid; the sampler's plausibility tests (attributed memory within the machine's, attributed CPU within `cores * 100`) are what fail if it comes back.
- `Session::terminate` kills the shell's whole process tree, not just the shell. `portable-pty`'s killer reaches the direct child only (`SIGHUP` on unix, `TerminateProcess` on Windows), and the kernel hangup that would sweep up the rest reaches only the controlling terminal's foreground group, so an agent CLI that daemonizes or an MCP server outlives the tab and keeps holding the worktree's working directory. The ordering in `shell_tree_termination.rs` is load-bearing and MUST NOT be rearranged: capture the subtree BEFORE the root is signalled, because a dead root's children reparent away and stop being reachable through it, and any row still naming the vacated pid is a pid-recycle coincidence. For the same reason a session whose shell already exited (`shell` cleared) MUST NOT be swept. Nothing is signalled without positive identity proof from the sealed start time: a failed or overrunning sweep leaks a tree, which is the correct way to fail, because guessing wrong signals a stranger's tree instead.
- Recurring host work that nobody reads while nobody is asking MUST go through `DemandDrivenTicker` (`rust/alera-cli/src/terminal_host/demand_driven_ticker.rs`) rather than an ad hoc `tokio::spawn` loop. The host is a sidecar and cannot see whether the app's window is visible, and it MUST NOT take a client's word for it either, because a client that reports going away may instead have died mid-report. Silence is the signal that survives both, so the ticker stops on an idle window and restarts on the next request. The idle window MUST be derived from the client's actual polling period rather than hardcoded: when the resource monitor's window was a constant that had to agree with a cadence chosen in Dart, the two drifted, the ticker stopped under a chip that was still polling on time, and the panel appeared to work only while the mouse hovered it. `resources.snapshot` carries `intervalMs` for exactly this, and the host sizes both its sampling interval and its idle window from it (`resource_idle_stop_for`); a request that omits it gets the host's defaults, so an older app is unaffected. The field is additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`. Restarting the ticker for a cadence change MUST NOT reset the sampler's CPU baseline - that reset exists for idle gaps, and doing it on every hover puts the panel back into "measuring".
- A client that fell behind is resynchronised from the delivery cursor the host keeps per client (`Session::delivered_output_cursors`), never by resending the scrollback. It falls behind two ways, a visibility pause and a full output queue, and both take the same path through `resume_output_for_client` (`rust/alera-cli/src/terminal_host/server/output_delivery.rs`). The cursor MUST advance only when a frame is *accepted* by that client's queue: advancing it on append makes a dropped frame a silent hole. The missed bytes MUST go out on the terminal lane ahead of the unpause, not inside the request's reply, because the reply travels on the control lane and the writer drains terminal frames first, so bytes returned inline can land after output that came later; the lane also feeds them through the client's per-session UTF-8 decoder, so a code point split at the pause boundary still joins up. A client the host cannot place in the stream gets a full snapshot instead, which is the only correct answer once the ring has dropped the gap. The Dart client MUST NOT discard output between losing visibility and the pause taking effect, because the host already counted those frames as delivered.
- The snapshot an attach or a resync replays is capped by `restoreSnapshotBytes`, which is separate from `scrollbackBytes` on purpose: the first is what a client's emulator will keep, the second is what the host retains so `terminal.read` and the coordinator tail can page back through it. Both are additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`; a host that receives no cap replays the whole buffer, which is what an older app expects.
- Cursor's hooks are delivered as a per-session plugin, never by writing the user's `~/.cursor/hooks.json`. `prepare_cursor` (`rust/alera-cli/src/agent_status/integration_config_cursor_overlay.rs`) mints a `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` plus `hooks/hooks.json` under the runtime directory and a `cursor-agent` wrapper that re-execs with `--plugin-dir`, and it MUST run from `prepare_enabled_integrations`, which the launch path calls **after** it strips inherited Alera values. Anything the Flutter side injects into the launch environment is removed by that strip, so a Dart-built overlay silently never reaches the PTY - that is exactly how the previous plugin path was dead while only the global install worked. The wrapper drops its own directory from `PATH` before resolving `cursor-agent`, or it resolves to itself. Alera MUST NOT write a `permission` verdict to stdout for `preToolUse`, `beforeShellExecution` or `beforeMCPExecution`: an `allow` there replaces Cursor's own approval prompt. Silence is the right answer *for Cursor* and only for Cursor - empty stdout with exit 0 is a documented fail-open there, whereas Antigravity and Copilot owe a JSON reply on every event, which is why the shared script answers for those two agent types and not this one. It is also why Cursor may install `preToolUse` while Antigravity may not install `PreToolUse`: the difference is whether the agent treats a missing decision as an error. Every definition carries an explicit `timeout` because Cursor's default is 60s. `beforeShellExecution`/`beforeMCPExecution` mean waiting and their `after` counterparts mean working; registering only the `before` half leaves a long command marked as needing attention for its whole run. `sessionStart` MUST stay unregistered - it fires before any prompt and normalizes to working. Which events fire depends on how the CLI was started, verified against `cursor-agent 2026.08.04`: an interactive run emits `sessionStart`, `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `afterAgentResponse`, `stop`, `sessionEnd`, while `-p` emits none of `beforeSubmitPrompt`, `afterAgentResponse` or `stop`, so `sessionEnd` is the only event that ends a headless run and MUST stay registered. Tool events (`preToolUse`, `beforeShellExecution`, `afterShellExecution`, `postToolUse`, in that order) fire in both.
- The desktop and mobile apps defer a project's worktree setup to a terminal tab named `Setup` instead of holding the New Workspace UI open until `pnpm install` finishes. `deferSetup` on `workspace.createManaged`, `deferredSetupCommand` on its response, and the `initialCommandOnce` tab payload key are additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`; a host that ignores the flag runs the setup inline and omits the command, which is exactly the old behavior. The tab runs one portable line (`/bin/sh "<script>"`, `cmd /d /c "<script>"`) against a host-generated script, and that indirection is load-bearing. `&&` cannot be used: the terminal hosts whatever interactive shell the user configured, PowerShell 5.1 rejects `&&` at parse time and nushell removed it. Writing one command per line up front cannot be used either, because PTY bytes go to the *foreground process*, so the second line lands on the first command's stdin. The Windows launcher omits `/s` on purpose - with it, cmd strips the outer quotes and a script path containing spaces breaks apart - and leaves `cmd` unquoted so PowerShell does not need the `&` call operator. Copy rules go through `alera workspace setup --copies-only` rather than being rewritten in shell, so `copy_rule_inner`'s symlink and path-escape validation stays in Rust. `initialCommandOnce` exists because agent tabs deliberately re-mint their `initialCommand` on every new PTY, so the clearing MUST stay opt-in.
- A spawnable agent receives its starting prompt **at launch**, in the shape its own CLI accepts, declared once per adapter as `startup_prompt` in `rust/alera-cli/src/terminal_host/orchestration/agent_registry.rs`. Typing the prompt into the running TUI instead is not an option and never was one: that path waits for an agent-status hook reporting `done`, and an agent that has been asked nothing never reports that it finished anything, so the prompt hung forever for every agent except Codex. `pendingAgentPrompt` and `pendingOrchestration` are no longer written, but their delivery paths MUST stay: the app attaches to whichever sidecar is already running, so a newer host has to be able to finish a delivery an older one started. The declared shapes are load-bearing per agent and were each verified against the installed CLI: `--` before a positional prompt for `codex`, `claude` and `cursor`; a bare positional for `pi`, which rejects `--` outright (`Error: Unknown option: --`) and so gets a leading space when the prompt opens with a dash, since it reads `-anything` as an option; and a single `--flag=<prompt>` token for `copilot`, `agy`, `opencode` and `opencode2`, which keeps a dash-prefixed prompt out of the parser without a terminator. OpenCode v1 (`opencode`) and OpenCode 2 (`opencode2`) are separate spawnable agent types that can run side by side; they share `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR` but install distinct plugins (`alera-agent-status.js` / `alera-agent-status-v2.js`) and hook routes (`/hook/opencode` / `/hook/opencode2`). The print/execute flags (`-p`, `--print`, `-x`) MUST NOT be used: they answer once and exit, leaving no agent in the tab. Because the launch line is typed into the user's interactive shell, a very long prompt is bounded by that shell's limit (8191 characters on cmd.exe).
- `amp` is the one agent with no initial-prompt option, so its prompt is written to a plain file and fed on stdin by a generated script, invoked through the same portable `/bin/sh "<script>"` / `cmd /d /c "<script>"` line the `Setup` tab uses. A pipeline typed into the terminal cannot be used: the prompt is free multi-line text and `<`, `echo` and quoting all differ across PowerShell 5.1, cmd and nushell. Only **stdin** is redirected, because `amp` switches itself into non-interactive execute mode when *stdout* is redirected, and leaving stdout on the PTY is what keeps the agent in the tab. Neither generated file deletes itself - the script is still being read when it `exec`s the agent, and the redirect has to outlive that handover - so the startup sweep next to `remove_stale_setup_scripts` is what clears them.
- An action that would otherwise print a command for the user to paste somewhere runs it in a command terminal instead (`lib/src/features/command_terminal/`, entered through `showCommandTerminalDialog`). The point is the PTY: `ProcessRunner.run` gives no TTY, so a `sudo` password prompt there hangs with nothing able to answer it, and the copy-the-command path existed because there was nowhere to type. The command is written into the user's own interactive shell as an `initialCommand`, exactly as the `Setup` tab does, so it MUST be one portable line and is subject to the same `&&` and one-command-per-line constraints described above. The session is synthetic and unpersisted, keyed by `commandTerminalWorkspaceId`, and the dialog owns its whole lifetime: it calls `runtime.closeTab` on dismissal, which terminates the shell's process tree. `terminalRuntimeExitCoordinator` MUST keep skipping that workspace id, because closing the session when the PTY exits would wipe the output at the exact moment the user wants to read it. Nothing detects when the command finished - the shell outlives it - so closing while the shell is alive asks first rather than guessing.
- The desktop Terminal Composer submits through the same host `deferredEnter` path as mobile and orchestration: the prompt bytes keep the emulator's live DECSET 2004 decision rather than the host `bracketedPaste` flag, so a future change does not collapse the payload and its Enter back into one PTY write.
- Runtime change events carry an optional scope id (`workspaceId`, `projectId`) and an absent or empty scope means wildcard: every watcher refreshes. The app can attach to an already-running sidecar, so an older host broadcasting an empty payload MUST keep working. Emit these events through the helpers in `rust/alera-cli/src/terminal_host/server/runtime_change_broadcasts.rs` and pass `None` whenever the mutation really is broader than one workspace or project. Never guess a scope: the wildcard is the safe value, a wrong id silently stops watchers from updating. Adding a scope field is additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`, because a version mismatch makes the app treat a live host as unusable.

## Computer Use

- Computer use lives in the sidecar (`rust/alera-cli/src/computer_use/`) and is reached only through the runtime host's `computer.*` verbs. The CLI MUST NOT drive the desktop itself: the host is the process inside the user's graphical session, so on Linux it holds the session bus and on macOS it is the identity TCC grants Accessibility to. A CLI that acted directly would ask whichever terminal launched it for those grants, which is a different grant per terminal.
- `computerUseV1` is additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`, because a version mismatch makes the app treat a live host as unusable.
- A computer-use failure travels inside a successful host response, carrying its error code and `nextSteps`. The transport error channel stays reserved for a host that could not process the request at all, which is what clients treat as fatal. A blocked app or a stale index is a normal outcome, not a broken connection.
- Element indexes are short-lived and **sparse**: compaction removes elements after they are numbered. Nothing may infer an index from `elementCount`, and the skill says so explicitly because models assume otherwise.
- An action MUST re-check the live element's signature (role, name, actions, child count) before touching it. The child-index path is not identity: a list that gained a row above the target keeps every path resolvable while every path points one row off, so path resolution alone would act on a stranger's row. A refusal there is the correct outcome.
- Observations are namespaced per caller, and a read and the action that follows it MUST send the same namespace. They disagreed once and every action reported a stale index; `computer_commands.rs` has a test on that agreement. An absent namespace gets its own bucket rather than a shared default, because a collision is a click on the wrong control rather than an error.
- Actions are serialized behind `action_gate`. There is one pointer, one keyboard focus, and one window stack; two actions at once interleave into a sequence neither caller asked for. Reads are deliberately not gated.
- Synthetic input MUST NOT be advertised where there is no route into the session. Under Wayland a client cannot inject input or capture the screen without the desktop portal, so those capabilities report false rather than failing per call, and an agent never plans around a verb that cannot work.
- Each platform reads its own accessibility layer in pure Rust inside the sidecar (`atspi`, `uiautomation`, `objc2-application-services`), so the single-binary packaging invariant holds. Providers MUST normalize roles to the AT-SPI spelling (`check box`, not `CheckBox` or `AXCheckBox`), because one set of role lists decides elision and redaction for every platform.
- Windows: UI Automation connects from session 0 and then reports an empty desktop, so a host over SSH or as a service would look available and see nothing. The handshake MUST compare its own session against the active console session and refuse with both numbers named. Screen coordinates are not the address there: the HWND is stable, so Windows is the one platform that advertises `windows.targetById`.
- macOS: TCC grants Accessibility per executable, so the refusal MUST name the binary rather than the app; granting it to another copy does not carry over. `AXIsProcessTrusted` is the non-prompting check and the only one runtime calls may use, because agents retry and the `WithOptions` form opens a dialog per retry.
- A node identical to its emitted parent (same role and name, no value, no actions, not focused) MUST be elided. A real macOS app nested an `AXApplication` inside its own `AXApplication` for dozens of levels, and without this the tree was nothing but identical lines until the depth budget cut it off. Leaves are exempt: an echoing leaf marks where content ends.
- Redaction applies only to text-bearing roles. Applying the word list to any role concealed KRunner's "Pin" checkbox, hiding a control the agent needed: a button named "Password" holds no secret. The platform's own concealed flag still wins whatever the role.
- Password managers are refused wholesale (`blocked_apps.rs`), not redacted field by field: their whole window is the secret. `computer.*` verbs MUST stay off the mobile allowlist, so a paired phone cannot drive the desktop; the allowlist is a whitelist and a conformance test keeps a later addition from granting it by accident.
- AT-SPI's `Application.Id` is a registry index, not a pid. The process id MUST come from the bus (`GetConnectionUnixProcessID`), or a `pid:` selector names a process that does not exist.

## Cloud Accounts And Mobile Push

- Alera accounts remain optional for every local feature. Google and GitHub identity, cloud sessions, mobile enrollment, and push delivery are additive capabilities and MUST NOT bump the strict terminal-host or mobile protocol versions.
- The cloud backend is an HTTP control plane only. It MUST NOT parse, proxy, or participate in the Alera terminal-host protocol; any future internet relay carries opaque end-to-end encrypted bytes.
- Provider client secrets, token-signing private material, refresh tokens, bearer tokens, and FCM registration tokens MUST NOT be committed, logged, or placed in release artifacts. The runtime stores account refresh credentials behind its credential-store boundary, and the mobile app uses platform secure storage.
- `account.*` requests remain local-client-only. The only mobile account bootstrap request is `mobile.cloudEnrollment.create`, and it uses the stable cloud installation id bound to the authenticated client by additive `mobile.hello.cloudDeviceId`, never an id supplied in that enrollment request. `mobile.cloudSubscriptions.refresh` may only ask the runtime to re-read its own authoritative count from Cloud; it never accepts a count or subscription claim from the phone.
- FCM tokens and per-runtime mobile subscriptions live in the cloud backend. A runtime emits idempotent domain events only after explicit runtime opt-in and never stores a phone's FCM token.
- Push payloads may contain the selected agent state plus project and workspace names. They MUST NOT contain prompts, commands, terminal input or output, source code, repository contents, or arbitrary orchestration text.
- Attention includes waiting and blocked agents, escalation and decision gates, and coordinator stall gates. Agent done and terminal exit remain separate default-off categories. Replayed snapshots, cooldown repeats, and nearby bursts MUST be damped before cloud delivery.

## Build Flavors

- Alera builds in two flavors selected by the `ALERA_FLAVOR` environment variable: `dev` (default) and `release`.
- The `dev` flavor uses `dev.leynier.alera.dev` as bundle identifier / GTK `APPLICATION_ID`, `alera-dev` as Windows/Linux binary name, and `Alera Dev` as the display name in the Dock, taskbar, and window title. This lets a locally running dev build coexist with an installed release build without sharing user-data directories (which are keyed by bundle id / application id).
- The `release` flavor keeps bundle identifier `dev.leynier.alera` and display name `Alera`. Its on-disk executable is `Alera` on Windows (`Alera.exe`) and macOS (`Alera.app`, via `ALERA_PRODUCT_NAME`), while the Linux binary stays lowercase `alera` by POSIX convention. `desktop_updater` copies the macOS bundle to `dist/` under the lowercase pubspec package name (`alera.app`), so `release-cut.yml` renames it to `Alera.app` before packaging the release tarball. The release flavor MUST be selected by CI for any artifact intended to be installed by an end user. `.github/workflows/desktop-build.yml` and `.github/workflows/release-cut.yml` set `ALERA_FLAVOR: release` at the job env level.
- The makefile defaults `ALERA_FLAVOR` to `dev` and forwards `--alera-flavor` to `tool/debug/alera_debug.dart`. The debug tool regenerates `macos/Runner/Configs/Flavor.xcconfig` (git-ignored) before each `flutter run` and exports `ALERA_FLAVOR` so the Windows/Linux CMake branches and the Dart-side `kAleraFlavor` constant agree. `Flavor.example.xcconfig` documents the dev-flavor values for reference.
- Auto-update MUST remain disabled on dev builds regardless of any other flag. The guard lives in `effectiveAutoInstallEnabled` (see `lib/src/core/build_flavor.dart`) and is applied by `AleraUpdateConfig.fromEnvironment()`.
- The canonical flavor identity strings (`Alera`, `Alera Dev`, `dev.leynier.alera`, `dev.leynier.alera.dev`, and the `release` / `dev` selectors) live in `lib/src/core/build_flavor.dart`. The macOS xcconfig generator in `tool/debug/alera_debug.dart` imports them so the regenerated `Flavor.xcconfig` cannot drift from the runtime Dart constants.
- The generated `macos/Runner/Configs/Flavor.xcconfig` reflects whatever flavor was most recently prepared by `tool/debug/alera_debug.dart`. If a contributor wants to rehearse a release build locally after running a dev `make` target, they MUST re-prepare the release flavor first (e.g. `ALERA_FLAVOR=release make app-debug`) or delete `Flavor.xcconfig` - otherwise `flutter build macos --release` will inherit the stale dev override.

## Release And Update Rules

- GitHub Actions work must follow `.github/AGENTS.md`.
- Release script work must follow `tool/release/AGENTS.md`.
- Stable auto-update is enabled on macOS and Windows regardless of platform signing, because update integrity rests on the Ed25519-signed manifest and its per-artifact SHA-256, not on Developer ID or Authenticode. Platform signing governs what the OS shows on first launch, which is a separate concern. Linux is included too, but which installation may be replaced is decided at runtime rather than per platform, and both conditions are load-bearing. An installation a package manager owns MUST NOT be replaced in place: the deb and rpm payload lives under `/opt/alera`, `packageManagerInstallFromExecutablePath` attributes that prefix to `PackageInstallMethod.linuxSystemPackage`, and those updates keep going through apt or dnf, which is also what resolves the `libmpv` dependency closure a raw `dpkg` transaction would not. A tarball installation replaces its own directory, which runs no package transaction and so needs no dependency resolution, but only after `canReplaceInstallDirectory` proves Alera can write there: failing part way through the swap is the one outcome that leaves the user with no app at all. The deb and rpm upgrade needs `sudo`, so it runs in the command terminal where a password prompt has a PTY, never in the detached shell Homebrew and Scoop use after the app has closed.
- Stable auto-update is additionally disabled whenever a package manager owns the installation. Homebrew, Scoop, and Chocolatey are detected from the resolved executable path in `lib/src/features/updater/domain/package_install_method.dart`, a pure function fed `Platform.resolvedExecutable` at the boundary; replacing the bundle behind the manager's back would leave its database naming a version that is no longer on disk. Homebrew and Scoop run their own upgrade through a detached system shell that waits for Alera to exit and reopens it (`package_manager_upgrade_script.dart`, `package_manager_update_launcher.dart`). Chocolatey MUST NOT: its upgrade needs elevation, and the UAC prompt would appear after Alera closed, so it keeps the copy-the-command path Linux uses. New package managers belong in that same enum and switch, never in an ad-hoc branch.
- Release automation must publish drafts first, verify all required assets and update manifests, and only then publish public releases.
- The desktop re-checks for a release every 15 minutes while the window is visible (`AleraUpdateCheckScheduler`), and parks while it is hidden: a check nobody can see the result of still costs a request, and on Linux still costs a composited frame. Returning to a visible window checks immediately rather than waiting out a fresh interval. A find is announced once per version by `UpdateAvailabilityWatch`, because the recurring check runs with nobody looking at Settings and a toast every 15 minutes for a release the user already declined is noise.
- The mobile app checks once per launch, Android only, and never auto-installs. It resolves the newest `vX.Y.Z-mobile` tag through the GitHub Releases API and offers the **universal** APK: per-ABI assets would need the device's ABI, which is a guess that fails on a device reporting several. Drafts and prereleases are skipped, because the release commit reaches `main` before the draft is published and a draft's assets 404 for everyone else. A failed check is silent: it is not worth interrupting a launch over a rate limit or a dead network.

## Diagnostics And Logging

- All three surfaces write rotating JSON Lines log files: the sidecar under `<runtimeDir>/logs/`, the desktop and mobile apps under `<applicationSupport>/logs/`. The canonical reference is `docs/diagnostics.md`.
- New diagnostics in the sidecar MUST use `tracing::warn!`/`error!`/`info!`, never `eprintln!`. The `println!`/`eprintln!` calls in `main.rs` and the `*_commands.rs` files are user-facing command output and stay as they are.
- Redaction lives in the sink, never at the call sites, because a diagnostics bundle is meant to be shared and a call site that forgets to mask is indistinguishable from one with nothing to mask. Register a newly minted secret with `register_secret` / `registerLogSecret` where it is created rather than trusting the pattern list.
- Crash reporting is opt-in and off by default, one Sentry project per surface. The switch is read inside `before_send`/`beforeSend` rather than by tearing the client down, so turning it off takes effect immediately, including on an already-running sidecar. DSNs are committed on purpose: a DSN is not a secret and ships inside the binary either way.
- The sidecar's panic hook MUST be installed before `sentry::init`, whose panic integration chains the previous hook. That ordering is what puts a panic in the local log file even when reporting is disabled or its upload fails.
- `logDirectory`, `crashReportingEnabled` on `status.get`, the `crashReporting` field on `configure`, and `hostDiagnosticsLogsV1` are additive and MUST NOT bump `aleraTerminalHostProtocolVersion`.
- Logging MUST NOT be able to stop the app from starting: every sink failure degrades to no file instead of throwing, and the settings applier falls back to defaults when settings are unavailable.

## Reference Projects

- `reference_projects/` contains non-runtime references for agentic development and orchestration patterns.
- `reference_projects/orca` is the primary reference for ADE-style collaboration, contribution workflow, release gates, and agent-facing project guidance.
- Reference projects MUST NOT become runtime dependencies of Alera.

## Documentation Maintenance

- After every feature, refactor, fix, or infrastructure change, explicitly consider whether `AGENTS.md`, nested `AGENTS.md` files, `readme.md`, `docs/`, `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, or release documentation need updates.
- If documentation does not need updates, mention that decision in the final summary or PR notes when the change is user-visible, architectural, process-related, release-related, or contributor-facing.
- Keep documentation aligned with implemented behavior. Do not document planned behavior as active behavior.

## Nested Instructions

- `landing/AGENTS.md` applies under `landing/`.
- `mobile/AGENTS.md` applies under `mobile/`.
- `test/AGENTS.md` applies under `test/`.
- `.github/AGENTS.md` applies under `.github/`.
- `tool/release/AGENTS.md` applies under `tool/release/`.
